### Demo

### How is it working:

It uses ricvalerio's ForegroundAppChecker(https://github.com/ricvalerio/foregroundappchecker) in background service which runs continously (even if app is killed, it runs) and if targeted app (Linkedin in this case) has been detected as opened, it injects custom fake login page to steal user credentials
Some permissions are required in order to work(maybe we can breach those perms too in the future?) (Lots of apps can grant these permission easily, eg. parental control apps)
